1.I used fragments.
2.I am using Recycler View to display all recipes item:
For Recycler view, we create a data class and an Adapter class
3.Then I used Navigation Component to navigate between varios destinations.For this I created a nav_graph,nav_host and nav_controller.
4.Now working on overflow menu to add new recipesby user. Creating Android Resource file under "Menu" type

-first create a fragment where we should go when clicked on menu item.
-add this fragment to nav_graph and give it a ID say "AB"
-create "MENU" resource type. add menu item in it. give this menu item ID same as "AB" as given to fragment in nav_graph
-then go to fragment where you want to add overflow menu and write code to add that menu.
